<p>I was born in the late 90s to a wonderful mother and father in the sunny beaches of California. As a baby, my mom would put my hair in a high-pony so it would look like a palm tree (she also claims it was for pratical purposes to keep my hair out of my eyes).</p>

<p>Tragically, when I was three my dad passed away, so we moved to Minnesota to be near family. Here, I got to meet my second dad and began to discover who I was. That turned out to be a cat-loving, goofy, and observational child. I often found myself looking at the world, rather than experiencing it myself.</p>
